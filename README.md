  * Project description and objectives
    In this project, we coded a finch robot through github. Our goal was to code the robot to draw a house on a piece of paper. We needed to make a couple methods to allow the robot to move, turn, and stop at the right times and lengths. We used a drawBox and drawRoof method to draw different parts of the house. 
  * Description of design choices
   We decided to design our robot to draw instead of dance or move through a maze because we thought drawing would be the most creative and unique out of all the choices. We decided to make a house using a purple marker due to the drawing restrictions of the robot that I will talk about in our challenges.
  * Challenges faced and solutions
   - In the VS code, it was very confusing and challenging to create the correct files and to navigate as we faced many errors.
   - Finding the certain speeds, angles, and lengths the robot should move to correctly draw the house was also difficult.
   - Thinking of ideas of what to draw were a bit challenging as the robot would always be constantly drawing as it could not pick up the marker meaning complex drawings could not be done without many steps. 
  * Future enhancements
    If we were to make future enhancements, we could make the house larger, have more details such as windows and doors, or have other background drawings. Though this would be quite difficult since the robot cannot pick up the marker meaning everything would be connected. Because of this, I also hope that the finch robots get a future enhancement as well making them able to pick up marker when prompted to.
